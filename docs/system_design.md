## System Design for Smart Logistics Optimization System

### Overview

The Smart Logistics Optimization System enhances logistics operations through advanced algorithms and real-time data processing. This document outlines its architecture, components, and integration.

### Architecture

#### Frontend (Client)

- **Framework:** React.js with Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Responsiveness:** Optimized for various screen sizes

#### Backend (Server)

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB for data storage and retrieval
- **Services:** API endpoints for CRUD operations and algorithmic computations

### Components

#### Client-side

- **Location Management:** CRUD operations for locations
- **Route Optimization:** Algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest path calculation
- **Real-time Updates:** Dynamic route adjustments and vehicle tracking

#### Server-side

- **API Endpoints:** Routes, vehicles, warehouses management
- **Algorithmic Services:** Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programming for optimization

### Integration and Scalability

Deployable on cloud platforms with scalability and monitoring for performance optimization.
